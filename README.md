# **How to play BC Hangman**

1. You will be directed to the main menu and will be given the choice to either play, add words, or quit.
2. During playing, do note that it will only accept latin characters (a-z)
3. For now, the 'add words' feature can't undo, so please be careful if you want to input more words.
4. word lists can be manually edited through 'words.txt' (first column for the word, and the next for hint).
5. Have fun playing!! :)
